# Project: Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is the use the following with an API call.

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls (MeaningCloud)

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called MeaningCloud has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article, sentence or blog post.

## Getting started

It would probably be good to first get your basic project setup and functioning. Follow the steps from the course up to Lesson 4 but don't add Service Workers just yet. We won't need the service workers during development and having extra caches floating around just means there's more potential for confusion. So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`


## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
